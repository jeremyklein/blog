## Outline Writing Tips

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Explain Docker concepts"
Use: "Container vs image differences, layering system, and volume mounting"

### Include Examples
Instead of: "Show authentication implementation"  
Use: "JWT token implementation with Express.js, including middleware setup and error handling"

### Think About Flow
- Start with basics, build complexity
- Each section should logically connect to the next
- Include transitions between major concepts

### Consider Your Audience
- What's their experience level?
- What tools/languages are they using?
- What problems are they trying to solve?

### Add Context Clues
- Mention specific tools, versions, or frameworks
- Include any prerequisites or setup requirements
- Note any platform-specific considerations

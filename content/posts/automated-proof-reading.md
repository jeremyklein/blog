# Automated Blog Proofreading with Claude AI and GitHub Actions

As a developer and blogger, I've always struggled with the final proofreading step. Technical writing demands precision, but catching every grammar mistake, awkward sentence, and unclear explanation can be tedious and time-consuming. That's when I discovered I could automate this process using Claude AI and GitHub Actions.

In this post, I'll walk you through setting up an automated proofreading system that reviews your blog posts whenever you create a pull request, providing detailed feedback without blocking your publishing workflow.

## Why Automate Proofreading?

Before diving into the implementation, let's consider the benefits:

**Consistency**: Every blog post gets the same level of scrutiny, regardless of how rushed you are to publish.

**Early Feedback**: Catches issues before publication, when they're easier to fix.

**Non-Blocking**: The system provides suggestions without preventing you from publishing - you maintain full control.

**Version Control Integration**: All proofreading feedback is tracked in your Git history, making it easy to reference later.

**Cost-Effective**: Using Claude 3 Haiku, each blog post costs only $0.01-0.05 to proofread.

## The Architecture

The system works elegantly within your existing Git workflow:

1. **Create a blog post** and commit it to a feature branch
2. **Open a pull request** targeting your main branch
3. **GitHub Actions detects** the PR contains blog post changes
4. **Claude analyzes** the content for grammar, clarity, flow, and technical accuracy
5. **Automated feedback** appears as PR comments
6. **Review and apply** suggestions before merging

## Implementation

### Step 1: GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/proofread.yml`:

```yaml
name: Automated Blog Proofreading

on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['content/posts/**/*.md']
    types: [opened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  proofread:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk

      - name: Run proofreading
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: node .github/scripts/proofread.js
```

### Step 2: Proofreading Script

The heart of the system is a Node.js script that:
- Detects changed markdown files
- Sends content to Claude for analysis
- Posts formatted feedback as PR comments

The script uses Claude 3 Haiku for cost efficiency while maintaining high-quality feedback. It analyzes:

- **Grammar and spelling** corrections
- **Writing clarity** and flow improvements  
- **Sentence structure** enhancements
- **Tone consistency** analysis
- **Technical accuracy** verification

### Step 3: API Key Configuration

Set up your Anthropic API key in GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and create an API key
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions  
3. Add a new repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
4. Paste your API key as the value

## Real-World Usage

Once configured, the workflow integrates seamlessly into your blogging process. Here's what a typical proofreading session looks like:

**The Feedback**: Claude provides specific, actionable suggestions organized by category. Instead of vague "improve this," you get concrete recommendations like "Consider splitting this 47-word sentence into two for better readability" or "The phrase 'leverage synergies' is jargon - try 'combine strengths' instead."

**Smart Updates**: When you push changes to address feedback, the system updates the same PR comment rather than creating multiple comments, keeping the conversation clean.

**Flexible Integration**: The system only triggers on blog post changes, so your other development workflows remain unaffected.

## Cost and Performance

Using Claude 3 Haiku keeps costs minimal:
- **Typical blog post**: $0.01-0.05 to proofread
- **Response time**: Usually completes within 30-60 seconds
- **Accuracy**: Consistently catches issues I would miss in manual reviews

For a blog publishing 4-8 posts per month, the total cost is under $1/month - essentially free compared to the time saved and quality improvement.

## Lessons Learned

After using this system for several months, here are key insights:

**Trust but Verify**: Claude's suggestions are remarkably good, but occasionally it flags technical terms or intentional stylistic choices. Always review before applying changes.

**Workflow Enhancement**: The system works best as an enhancement to your existing process, not a replacement for human judgment.

**Iterative Improvement**: You can customize the prompting to match your writing style and technical focus areas.

## Looking Forward

This automated proofreading system has transformed my blogging workflow. What used to be a dreaded final step is now an anticipated source of helpful feedback. The integration is so seamless that I often forget it's AI-powered until I see the thoughtful suggestions appear.

Future enhancements I'm considering include:
- Style guide enforcement for consistent voice across posts
- Technical accuracy verification against documentation
- SEO optimization suggestions
- Integration with content planning workflows

## Getting Started

The complete implementation, including setup instructions and troubleshooting tips, is available in my blog's repository. The system takes about 15 minutes to set up and immediately starts improving your content quality.

Whether you're a solo blogger or part of a team, automated proofreading with Claude AI can elevate your technical writing while streamlining your publishing workflow. Give it a try - your readers (and your future self) will thank you.

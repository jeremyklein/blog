# Outline

- Hook: Why most developers only scratch the surface of Git's capabilities
- The progression: From git add/commit/push to power user workflows
- Essential concepts often misunderstood:
  - Working directory vs staging area vs repository
  - Local vs remote repositories and their relationship
  - Branches as lightweight movable pointers, not directories
- Intermediate workflows that boost productivity:
  - Feature branch workflow with clean history
  - Interactive staging with `git add -p`
  - Amending commits and rewriting history safely
- Advanced techniques for real-world scenarios:
  - Interactive rebase for cleaning up commit history
  - Cherry-picking specific commits across branches
  - Using `git bisect` to find bugs efficiently
  - Stashing work-in-progress effectively
- Collaboration best practices:
  - When to rebase vs merge and why it matters
  - Handling merge conflicts like a pro
  - Code review workflow with feature branches
- Recovery and troubleshooting:
  - Undoing changes at different stages
  - Finding and recovering lost commits with reflog
  - Dealing with detached HEAD state
- Tools and aliases that enhance the Git experience
- Conclusion: Building Git mastery through deliberate practice
